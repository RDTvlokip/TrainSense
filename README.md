# TrainSense

TrainSense is an ultra robust Python package for deep analysis of deep learning model architectures, advanced hyperparameter optimization, and comprehensive system diagnostics. It can automatically detect various layer types (e.g., LSTM, RNN, CNN, Transformer, GPT, etc.), provide detailed hyperparameter recommendations, profile model performance, and retrieve system information (including CUDA and cuDNN versions).  

## Features

- **Architecture Analysis**  
  Detects the number of parameters, counts layers, identifies layer types, and infers the overall architecture (e.g., CNN, LSTM, Transformer).

- **Hyperparameter Evaluation & Optimization**  
  Checks and recommends adjustments for batch size, learning rate, and epochs based on your system configuration and model complexity. It even provides automatic adjustments.

- **Model Profiling**  
  Benchmarks the model by measuring average inference time, throughput, and (if applicable) GPU memory usage.

- **System Diagnostics**  
  Retrieves detailed system information including CPU count, total memory, GPU details, CUDA version, cuDNN version, OS information, and real-time usage statistics.

- **Enhanced Logging**  
  Provides enriched, timestamped logs of all analysis steps for better traceability and debugging.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or newer
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) (install via pip or conda)
- [psutil](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/)
- [GPUtil](https://pypi.org/project/GPUtil/) (optional, for GPU monitoring)

### Install via PyPI

```bash
pip install trainsense
```

### Install in Development Mode

Clone the repository, navigate to the root directory (which contains `setup.py`), and run:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## How It Works

TrainSense is composed of several modules that work together to provide a complete analysis of your model and system:

1. **System Configuration & Diagnostics**  
   - *SystemConfig*: Retrieves hardware details such as CPU count, total memory, GPU info, CUDA and cuDNN versions, and OS details.
   - *SystemDiagnostics*: Provides real-time usage statistics like CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and uptime.

2. **Architecture Analysis**  
   - *ArchitectureAnalyzer*: Inspects your model to count parameters, layers, and detect layer types. It also infers the model architecture (e.g., CNN, LSTM) and provides recommendations based on complexity.

3. **Hyperparameter Analysis**  
   - *TrainingAnalyzer*: Evaluates your hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate, epochs) in light of your system and model architecture. It provides detailed recommendations and can automatically suggest adjustments.

4. **Model Profiling & Optimization**  
   - *ModelProfiler*: Benchmarks the model to measure average inference time and throughput.  
   - *OptimizerHelper & UltraOptimizer*: Offer suggestions on which optimizer to use and compute optimal hyperparameters based on your training data size, model complexity, and system resources.

5. **Deep Analysis**  
   - *DeepAnalyzer*: Combines results from all modules to generate a comprehensive report with overall recommendations and key performance metrics.

6. **Logging**  
   - *TrainLogger*: Captures detailed logs with timestamps, making it easier to trace and debug each step of the analysis.

### Explanation

1. **Configuration and Diagnostics:**  
   The `SystemConfig` and `SystemDiagnostics` modules collect your hardware and system usage data, including details about GPUs, CUDA/cuDNN versions, and OS information.

2. **Model Architecture Analysis:**  
   The `ArchitectureAnalyzer` inspects your model to count parameters, layers, and detect specific layer types. It infers the overall architecture (e.g., CNN, LSTM) and provides tailored recommendations.

3. **Hyperparameter Analysis:**  
   `TrainingAnalyzer` uses system and architecture info to verify that your chosen batch size, learning rate, and epochs are appropriate. It offers detailed recommendations and can automatically suggest adjustments.

4. **Performance Profiling:**  
   The `ModelProfiler` benchmarks your model by measuring inference speed and throughput. This helps in fine-tuning hyperparameters further.

5. **Advanced Optimization:**  
   `OptimizerHelper` and `UltraOptimizer` provide further recommendations on optimizer choice and compute optimal hyperparameters based on your model and system stats.

6. **Deep Analysis Report:**  
   `DeepAnalyzer` compiles all the above information into a comprehensive report with overall recommendations and performance metrics.

7. **Logging:**  
   The `TrainLogger` writes detailed, timestamped logs of each step, which is useful for debugging and tracking changes.
